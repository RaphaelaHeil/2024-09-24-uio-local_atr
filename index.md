This workshop introduces learners to the automatic text recognition (ATR) tool suite "[Loghi](https://github.com/knaw-huc/loghi)". This collection of tools can be used locally, i.e., without uploading data to a foreign server or a cloud service, which may not be an option for projects with stricter data protection guidelines.

The workshop will briefly introduce ATR and its capabilities and limitations. Afterwards, learners will be introduced to Loghi's command-line interface, and we will practice using a previously trained model to recognise text, prepare our data for training, and utilise it to train a new model.
